# Directus + Sveltekit demo

The www folder contains a SvelteKit project that can get JSON data from the fake-data-source dummy server or from the Directus CMS.

It can run in spa mode or render static files.

Follow the instructions in each folder to run them.

Remember to add the Directus JWT token to the token const in the +page.server.js file.

##Â Requirements

Node for SvelteKit and the fake server and Docker for Directus.
